    "\n",
    "Every year since 2005, the `World Happiness Report <https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2018/>`_ \n",
    "has analysed the results of the Gallup World Poll, \n",
    "which is carried out in 160 countries (covering 99% of the world’s population). \n",
    "The pollsters contact a random sample of people in each country and ask them over \n",
    "100 questions about their income, their health and their family. These questions include the \n",
    "following question about happiness:\n",
    "\n",
    ".. image:: ../../images/lesson1/HappyQuestion.png\n",
    "\n",
    "People living in different countries give different answers. In the UK it is 6.94, making the UK 17th in the world for happiness. \n",
    "The top ranked country --- rather surprisingly given a national stereotype of people who are reserved and don’t express their \n",
    "feelings very much --- is Finland, with a score of 7.82. In general, Scandinavian and Northern European countries are \n",
    "ranked highest. The USA is 16th (0.03 points ahead of the UK). China, with a score of 5.59 and at 72nd place, is \n",
    "roughly in the middle of the table of the countries surveyed. Other mid-ranked countries include Montenegro, Ecuador, \n",
    "Vietnam and Russia. Further down the table, we find many African --- Uganda and Ethiopia placed 117th and 131st, \n",
    "respectively, Middle Eastern countries --- Iran is at 110 and Yemen at 132.  \n",
    "The unhappiest country in the world in 2022 is Afghanistan, with an average happiness score of only 2.40.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is what makes people happy? One possible answer is that people are happier when they live longer. \n",
    "It is this relationship in data that we will explore in this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The methods\n",
    "-----------\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will learn about plotting and looking for relationships in data;\n",
    "fitting straight lines through data points; understanding the slope and intercept of the line \n",
    "as parameters in a mathematical model; and showing that the parameters are the best possible fit to the data. \n",
    "These are all key data science skills and also the first steps towards machine learning. Specifically,\n",
    "we will find out more about a method known as linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get to linear regression, we are going to go take detour into another part of mathematics: \n",
    "calculus. When you studied calculus at school or university, you probably didn't associate it with finding statsitical\n",
    "relationships in data. But in machine learning, we are often interested in finding the minimum value of a function, and for that \n",
    "we need to go back to differentiation. Once we have done that, \n",
    "we will use differentiation to find the slope of a line which minimises the distances \n",
    "between points and a line through those points.\n",
    "\n",

    "This material is taught as part of a 6 hour learning session. \n",
    "If you are doing this as part of an organised study group, your Kujenga instructor \n",

    "At the section on differentiation, solve the paper and \n",

    "\n",
    "To do the computer exercise, you will need to have a Python environment set up on your computer or access via Google Colab (see here for\n",
    "info on how to set that up). Then you can download this page as a Jupyter notebook or as Python code by clicking the links at\n",
    "the bottom of this page. You should also download the `data <https://github.com/AfricaEuropeCoreAI/Kujenga/blob/main/course/lessons/data/HappinessData.csv>`_ \n",
    "for the exercise. Run the code and focus on understanding what it does up to and including section `Finding the best fit line`_. \n",
    "\n",
    "*During class*: Your teacher will start by going through the theory for `Finding the best fit line`_. \n",
    "Please ask them questions and actively engage! This is your chance to really understand what is going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "*After class*: The section `Exercise: look for other predictors of happiness`_ gives the exercises you will need to hand in to\n",
