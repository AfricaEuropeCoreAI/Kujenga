What you will learn
===================

The problem
-----------

Are Ethipian or Kenyan runners the best in the world? This is a question that has been asked many times.
In this lesson we will learn how to test a hypothesis using data. 

The methods
-----------------

We will learn how to plot a histogram and how to use a statistical test (t-test) to compare two means. 
For more information on the type of test we will look at see `here https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/significance-tests-one-sample`_. 


How to use this material
------------------------

This material is taught as part of a 6 hour learning session. Your Kujenga instructor will have booked 
a time for an in-person or online two hour session. This means you have two hours to work to do either side of the
session. Here is what you should do:

*Before coming to the class*: You should read through this entire page. At the section on calculating a confidence interval
for a mean. If you get stuck look 
`here <https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/confidence-intervals-one-sample/estimating-population-mean/v/introduction-to-t-statistics>`_. 
After that section you should simply read through and try to understand what we are doing. 

Once you have read through, you should 
download this page as a Jupyter notebook or as Python code by clicking the links at the bottom of this page.
You will need to have a Python environment set up on your computer or access via Google Colab (see here for
 info on how to set that up). Please make sure you have the notebook and a Python environment set up before the class.

 *During class*: Your teacher will start by going through the theory for `the t-test`_. 
 Please ask them questions and actively engage!
