        "\n\n# The SIR model\n\n# What you will learn\n\n**Preamble**: \nImagine a new virus emerges in your community. At first, only a few people are infected but soon hospitals in your city begin to fill up.\n\nYou are asked a critical question: Can we predict when this outbreak will be at it\u2019s peak, how many people will get infected, and what interventions could stop it?\nDid you know that ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are not abstract math but a tool for saving lives in a case like this?\n\nThese questions can be answered using the SIR model. The Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) model can be described using three differential equations. \n\n`But, can these ordinary differential equations really describe the story of an outbreak from start to end?`\n\nIn the first video, Patience answers this question as she takes us through the mathematical foundations of the SIR model often referred to as `The Math of Epidemics`.\n\nShe explains the total population(N) which consists of 3 populations of individuals often referred to as compartments of the SIR model. The susceptible(S) individuals who are at an increased risk of infection and may require interventions such as vaccination or chemoprophylaxis, social distancing etc. to prevent diseases. They do not have the virus but could catch it. The Infected/Infectious(I) people who have the virus and can spread it to those who are susceptible and the Recovered(R) people who have had the virus, have recovered, and can no longer spread the virus.\n\nShe also explains two key variables; \u03b2 which is the disease transmission rate and \u03b3 which is the recovery rate\n\n## Assumptions of the SIR Model\n\n**The SIR model operates on 4 assumptions**: \n\n1.      The total population N is constant in time i.e No births, deaths or migration\n\n2.      There is a homogeneous mixing of the infected and susceptible populations\n\n3.      Individuals who recover from the disease gain permanent immunity\n\n4.      Both the rate of Infection and the rate of recovery are constant\n\n# Deriving the differential equations by hand\n\nPATIENCE'S VIDEO HERE\n\n## The 3 differential Equations\n\nIn the SIR model, the rate of change of susceptible individuals is\n\n\\begin{align}:label: susc\\end{align}\n \n   \\frac{dS}{dt} = -\\beta S I \n\nand the rate of change of infectives is \n\n\\begin{align}:label: infect\\end{align}\n \n   \\frac{dI}{dt} = \\beta S I - \\gamma I\n\nThe constant $\\beta$ is the rate of contact between people and $\\gamma$ is the rate of recovery.\nWe can also write down an equation for recovery as follows,\n\n\\begin{align}:label: recover\\end{align}\n \n   \\frac{dR}{dt} = \\gamma I\n\nIn this model $S$, $I$ and $R$ are proportions of the population. Summing them up gives $S+I+R=1$, since \neveryone in the popultaion is either susceptible, infective or recovered.\n\nWhile it is very important to understand this math, python makes it easier for us to solve these equations by importing key python libraries without having to manually do these calculations.\n\nLet\u2019s now solve these equations numerically in python. We start by importing the libraries we need from Python.\n\n# Doing it numerically in python\n"

        "\"\"\"\n\nPhase Planes and nullclines\n===========================\n\nIn this section, Emily introduces the concept of **phase planes and nullclines** in the video below, \nusing the SIR model as an example.\n\n.. youtube:: oYcNqe9KlDk\n    :width: 100%\n     :align: center\n\nThe material that follows recaps what is covered in the video, with supporting code \nand explanations to help you explore phase planes for yourself.\n\n\"\"\"\n\n# What are Phase Planes, and Why Do We Use Them?\n# ---------------------------------------------\n# A phase plane is a graphical representation of a dynamical system i.e a system described by \n# differential equations where we plot one variable against another instead of plotting them over time.\n# Phase planes provide a powerful visualization method for dynamic systems.\n#\n#Why a dynamic system?\n# --------------------\n# In mathematics and epidemiology, a system means a set of linked equations that describe how \n# variables change over time. So the SIR model is a dynamic system because the numbers of S,I and \n# R are continuously changing as the epidemic evolves i.e When there are many susceptibles and \n# few infected, the rate of infection is high, as susceptibles decrease, the rate of infection slows down \n# and when almost everyone is recovered, the infection fades away. The trajectory of the epidemic \n# (rise, peak, decline) is a dynamic response to how the parts of the system interact over time\n# Instead of observing each variable separately over time, phase planes plot one variable\n# against another. In our case, a common representation for the SIR model is the interaction \n# between the Susceptible (S) and Infected (I) groups. This is used both in in Emily's video, and\n# further below in the code examples.\n# \n# This visualization allows us to better understand complex system behaviors, such as:\n# \n# 1. The spread of disease over time\n# \n# 2. Stabilization points (equilibrium)\n# \n# 3. The eventual decline or extinction of an epidemic\n#\n# Phase planes highlight crucial relationships, equilibrium points, and system behavior\n# that can inform predictions about the long-term outcomes of an epidemic.\n#\n# Key Components of Phase Planes\n# ------------------------------\n# To fully understand phase planes, let\u2019s examine their key components:\n#\n# **Axes**:\n#     The axes of a phase plane represent the system variables, which is Susceptible (S) and Infected (I) in this case.\n#     By plotting one variable against another, we can see how these groups interact directly, rather than just observing \n#     their individual changes over time.\n#\n# **Trajectories**:\n#     Trajectories portray the state of the system as it evolves. \n#     For the SIR model in particular, the trajectory describes how the numbers of susceptible and infected individuals change in relation \n#     to one another as the epidemic progresses over time.\n#\n# **Directional Arrows**:\n#     These arrows on the phase plane indicate the direction of movement over time, showing how the system transitions between states.\n#     They guide us through the epidemic's progression, pointing from higher susceptibility toward states of greater infection or recovery.\n#\n# Below is the first example of a phase plane showing how the SIR system evolves over time, \n# with Susceptible (S) on the x-axis and Infected (I) on the y-axis. \n\n\nbeta = 1/2\ngamma = 1/7\n\ndef _dXdt_for_phase(X, t=0, beta_val=beta, gamma_val=gamma):\n    S, I, R = X\n    dSdt = -beta_val * S * I\n    dIdt = beta_val * S * I - gamma_val * I\n    dRdt = gamma_val * I\n    return [dSdt, dIdt, dRdt]\n\ndef plotPhasePlane(ax, Svals, Ivals):\n    ax.plot(Svals, Ivals, '-', color='k')\n    ax.set_xlabel('Susceptibles: S')\n    ax.set_ylabel('Infectives: I')\n    ax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)\n    ax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)\n    ax.set_xticks(np.arange(0, 1.01, step=0.5))\n    ax.set_yticks(np.arange(0, 1.01, step=0.5))\n    ax.set_ylim(0, 1)\n    ax.set_xlim(0, 1)\n\ndef drawArrows(ax, beta_val=beta, gamma_val=gamma):\n    x = np.linspace(0.05, 1, 6)\n    y = np.linspace(0.05, 1, 6)\n    Xgrid, Ygrid = np.meshgrid(x, y)\n    # Vector field components on the grid:\n    dS = -beta_val * Xgrid * Ygrid\n    dI = beta_val * Xgrid * Ygrid - gamma_val * Ygrid\n    M = np.hypot(dS, dI)\n    M[M == 0] = 1.0          \n    dSu = dS / M\n    dIu = dI / M\n    ax.quiver(Xgrid, Ygrid, dSu, dIu, pivot='mid', scale=20)\n\n\nt_phase = np.linspace(0, 160, 800)\nX0_phase = np.array([0.9999, 0.0001, 0.0])\n\nX_phase = odeint(_dXdt_for_phase, X0_phase, t_phase)\nS_phase, I_phase, R_phase = X_phase.T\n\n# Plot\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 6))\nplotPhasePlane(ax, S_phase, I_phase)\ndrawArrows(ax, beta_val=beta, gamma_val=gamma)\n\n# Nullcline (vertical line at S = gamma/beta)\nax.plot([gamma / beta, gamma / beta], [-1, 2], linestyle=':', color='k')\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()"

        "Equilibrium Points and Nullclines\n ---------------------------------\n One essential element of phase planes is the determination of equilibrium points. These \n points occur where the rates of change for both Susceptible (S) and Infected (I) are zero. \n The lines where the rate of change of a variable is equal to zero are called **nullclines**.\n The intersection of these nullclines determines the equilibrium points, which are \n crucial to understanding how an epidemic evolves. \n As the system evolves, either the susceptibles (S) becomes zero or the Infected(I) become zero and \n the point at which they intersect where S=0 (vertical axis) and I=0(horizontal axis) is the \n equilibrium. This is the **S-nullcline**. \n The **I-nullcline** is where I=0 or \u03b2S- \u03b3 = 0 and if we make S the subject, then S=\u03b3/\u03b2\n So the I-nullclines are I=0(horizontal axis) and S=\u03b3/\u03b2 (vertical axis)\n\n S=\u03b3/\u03b2  is very important because it represents the threshold for the outbreak.\n **This is also referred to as the R_o** (basic reproductive number/ratio). \n\n Similar to the `predator prey model<rabbitsandfoxes>`, we can find the equilibria for the infected population, where the rate at which \n people become infected equals the rate at which they recover. This is done by solving:\n\n .. math::\n    \\frac{dI}{dt} = \\beta S I - \\gamma I = 0\n\n This occurs either when $I=0$ (no one has the disease) or \n when $S=\\gamma/\\beta$.\n\n For the susceptible population:\n\n .. math::\n    \\frac{dS}{dt} = -\\beta S I = 0\n\n which simplifies to $I = 0$ or $S = 0$.

This indicates that, for a higher transmission rate, fewer susceptible \n   individuals remain in the population when the epidemic reaches equilibrium.
