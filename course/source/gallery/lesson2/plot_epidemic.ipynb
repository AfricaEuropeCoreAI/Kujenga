        "\n\n# The SIR model\n  \nIn the SIR model, the rate of change of susceptible individuals is\n\n\\begin{align}:label: susc\\end{align}\n \n   \\frac{dS}{dt} = -\\beta S I \n\nand the rate of change of infectives is \n\n\\begin{align}:label: infect\\end{align}\n \n   \\frac{dI}{dt} = \\beta S I - \\gamma I\n\nThe constant $\\beta$ is the rate of contact between people and $\\gamma$ is the rate of recovery.\nWe can also write down an equation for recovery as follows,\n\n\\begin{align}:label: recover\\end{align}\n \n   \\frac{dR}{dt} = \\gamma I\n\nIn this model $S$, $I$ and $R$ are proportions of the population. Summing them up gives $S+I+R=1$, since \neveryone in the popultaion is either susceptible, infective or recovered.\n\n# Deriving the Equations\n\nIn the video, Patience described the three compactment of the SIR model as the susceptible, infective and recovered groups.\nWhere the number of Susceptible individual at time :t: is represented as $S(t)$;  the number of infective individuals as $I(t)$ \nand the number of recovered individuals is $R(t)$.\n\nAlso, in the SIR model, we assume that the disease is spread through contact between susceptible and infective individuals and that a recovered individual developed immunity to the disease.\nWe also assume that the population is closed, meaning that there are no births, deaths or migration.\nMeaning that if N is the total population, then at any time $t$, we have $S(t) + I(t) + R(t) = N$.\n\nThats a lot of assumptions right? I agree, but hang on, it will all come together after we derive the equations.\n\nHowever, we still need to define few extra things we will need.\n\n- Let's define $\\beta$ as the transmission rate, which represents the rate at which susceptible individuals become infected through contact with infective individuals. and,\n- $\\gamma$ as the recovery rate, which represents the rate at which infective individuals recover from the disease and move to the recovered compartment.\n\nNow that we have these definitions, we can start deriving the equations.\n\nTo get concerned about an infectious disease spreading, there must have been someone infected,else there is no point of doing all this, therefore we assume $I > 0$. Also, the number of people infected would increase the chances of a susceptible individual coming into contact with an infective individual. Therefore, we can calculate the number of subsceptible indiviudal that will get infected as follows:\n\n\\begin{align}\\text{Rate of S} =\\frac{ \\beta S I}{N}\\end{align}\n\nAlso, the number of recovered individuals can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\begin{align}\\text{Rate of R} =\\gamma I\\end{align}\n\nNow we can estimate the change in each of the groups. To achieve this, we will take the different between the number of individual entered a group and the number that is leaving the group. lets represent this number as:\n\n$\\frac{dS}{dt}$ for the subsceptible group,\n\n$\\frac{dI}{dt}$ for the infective group and,\n\n$\\frac{dR}{dt}$ for the recovered group. We will have the following equations:\n\n\\begin{align}:label: dSdt\n\n    \\frac{dS}{dt} = | In - Out | = 0 -  \\frac{\\beta S I}{N} = - \\frac{\\beta S I}{N}\\end{align}\n\nSince no individual is entering the subsceptible group.\n\n\\begin{align}:label: dIdt\n\n    \\frac{dI}{dt} = | In - Out | =  \\frac{\\beta S I}{N} -  \\gamma I\\end{align}\n\n\\begin{align}:label: dRdt\n\n    \\frac{dR}{dt} = | In - Out | =  \\gamma I - 0 =  \\gamma I\\end{align}\n\nThe out in :eq: `dRdt` is zero since we assume individuals that have recovered from the disease develop immunity and cannot be infected again.\n\n\nLet's now solve these equations numerically. We start by importing the libraries we need from Python.\n"

        "# Phase Planes\nIn this section, Emily introduces the concept of **phase planes** in the video below,\nusing the SIR model as an example.\n\n.. youtube:: oYcNqe9KlDk\n    :width: 100%\n    :align: center\n\nThe material that follows recaps what is covered in the video, with supporting code\nand explanations to help you explore phase planes for yourself.\n\n## What are Phase Planes, and Why Do We Use Them?\nPhase planes provide a powerful visualization method for dynamic systems.\nInstead of observing each variable separately over time, phase planes plot one variable\nagainst another. In our case, a common representation for the SIR model is the interaction\nbetween the Susceptible (S) and Infected (I) groups. This is used both the video, and\nfurther below in the code examples.\n\nThis visualization allows us to better understand complex system behaviors, such as:\n\n- The spread of disease over time\n- Stabilization points (equilibrium)\n- The eventual decline or extinction of an epidemic\n\nPhase planes highlight crucial relationships, equilibrium points, and system behavior\nthat can inform predictions about the long-term outcomes of an epidemic.\n\n## Key Components of Phase Planes\nTo fully understand phase planes, let\u2019s examine their key components:\n\n**Axes**:\n    The axes of a phase plane represent the system variables, which is Susceptible (S) and Infected (I) in this case.\n    By plotting one variable against another, we can see how these groups interact directly, rather than just observing\n    their individual changes over time.\n\n**Trajectories**:\n    Trajectories portray the state of the system as it evolves.\n    For the SIR model in particular, the trajectory describes how the numbers of susceptible and infected individuals change in relation\n    to one another as the epidemic progresses over time.\n\n**Directional Arrows**:\n    These arrows on the phase plane indicate the direction of movement over time, showing how the system transitions between states.\n    They guide us through the epidemic's progression, pointing from higher susceptibility toward states of greater infection or recovery.\n\nBelow is the first example of a phase plane showing how the SIR system evolves over time,\nwith Susceptible (S) on the x-axis and Infected (I) on the y-axis.\n\n"

These\npoints occur where the rates of change for both Susceptible (S) and Infected (I) are zero.\nThe lines where the rate of change of a variable is equal to zero are called **nullclines**.\nThe intersection of these nullclines determines the equilibrium points, which are\ncrucial to understanding how an epidemic evolves.\n\nSimilar to the `predator prey model<rabbitsandfoxes>`, we can find the equilibria for the infected population, where the rate at which\npeople become infected equals the rate at which they recover. This is done by solving:\n\n\\begin{align}\\frac{dI}{dt} = \\beta S I - \\gamma I = 0\\end{align}\n\nThis occurs either when $I=0$ (no one has the disease) or\nwhen $S=\\gamma/\\beta$.\n\nFor the susceptible population:\n\n\\begin{align}\\frac{dS}{dt} = -\\beta S I = 0\\end{align}\n\nwhich simplifies to $I = 0$ or $S = 0$.
