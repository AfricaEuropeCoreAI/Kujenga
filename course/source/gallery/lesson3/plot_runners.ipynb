        "\n\n# What you will learn\n\n## The problem\n\nAre Ethipian or Kenyan runners the best in the world? This is a question that has been asked many times.\nIn this lesson we will learn how to test a hypothesis using data. \n\n## The methods\n\nWe will learn how to plot a histogram and how to use a statistical test (t-test) to compare two means.\n\n\n## How to use this material\n\nThis material is taught as part of a 6 hour learning session. Your Juenga instructor will have booked \na time for an in-person or online two hour session. This means you have two hours to work to do either side of the\nsession. Here is what you should do:\n\n*Before coming to the class*: You should read through this entire page. At the section on plotting data, try to \ncreate a histogram before coming to class. If you get stuck look [here](LINK NEEDED)), but otherwise you should \nsimply read through and try to understand what we are doing. Once you have read through, you should \ndownload this page as a Jupyter notebook or as Python code by clicking the links at the bottom of this page.\nYou will need to have a Python environment set up on your computer or access via Google Colab (see here for\n info on how to set that up). ...\n\n *During class*: Your teacher will start by going through the theory for `the t-test`_. \n Please ask them questions and actively engage! \n\n# Working with data\n\n\n## Loading in the data set\n"
