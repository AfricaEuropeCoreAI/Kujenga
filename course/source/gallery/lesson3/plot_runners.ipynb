        "\n\n# What you will learn\n\n## The problem\n\nAre Ethipian or Kenyan runners the best in the world? This is a question that has been asked many times.\nIn this lesson we will learn how to test a hypothesis using data. \n\n## The methods\n\nWe will learn how to plot a histogram and how to use a statistical test (t-test) to compare two means. \nFor more information on the type of test we will look at see `here https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/significance-tests-one-sample`_. \n\n\n## How to use this material\n\nThis material is taught as part of a 6 hour learning session. Your Kujenga instructor will have booked \na time for an in-person or online two hour session. This means you have two hours to work to do either side of the\nsession. Here is what you should do:\n\n*Before coming to the class*: You should read through this entire page. At the section on calculating a confidence interval\nfor a mean. If you get stuck look \n[here](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/confidence-intervals-one-sample/estimating-population-mean/v/introduction-to-t-statistics). \nAfter that section you should simply read through and try to understand what we are doing. \n\nOnce you have read through, you should \ndownload this page as a Jupyter notebook or as Python code by clicking the links at the bottom of this page.\nYou will need to have a Python environment set up on your computer or access via Google Colab (see here for\n info on how to set that up). Please make sure you have the notebook and a Python environment set up before the class.\n\n *During class*: Your teacher will start by going through the theory for `the t-test`_. \n Please ask them questions and actively engage! \n\n# Working with data\n\n\n## Loading in the data set\n"
