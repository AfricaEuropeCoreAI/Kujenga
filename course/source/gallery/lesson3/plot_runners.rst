What you will learn
===================

The problem
-----------

Are Ethipian or Kenyan runners the best in the world? This is a question that has been asked many times.
In this lesson we will learn how to test a hypothesis using data. 

The methods
-----------------

We will learn how to plot a histogram and how to use a statistical test (t-test) to compare two means. 
For more information on the type of test we will look at see `here https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/significance-tests-one-sample`_. 


How to use this material
------------------------

This material is taught as part of a 6 hour learning session. Your Kujenga instructor will have booked 
a time for an in-person or online two hour session. This means you have two hours to work to do either side of the
session. Here is what you should do:

*Before coming to the class*: You should read through this entire page. At the section on calculating a confidence interval
for a mean. If you get stuck look 
`here <https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/confidence-intervals-one-sample/estimating-population-mean/v/introduction-to-t-statistics>`_. 
After that section you should simply read through and try to understand what we are doing. 

Once you have read through, you should 
download this page as a Jupyter notebook or as Python code by clicking the links at the bottom of this page.
You will need to have a Python environment set up on your computer or access via Google Colab (see here for
 info on how to set that up). Please make sure you have the notebook and a Python environment set up before the class.

 *During class*: Your teacher will start by going through the theory for `the t-test`_. 
 Please ask them questions and actively engage!

Mathematically proving if the Kenyan runners are faster than the Ethiopian runners
=================

In order to establish if the Kenyan runners are faster than the Ethiopian runners. We will need to carry out a t-test.
A t-test is a statistical analysis tool that will tell you if two groups are statistically different. That the difference observed is not by chance.
In order to carry out a t-test, we need to have set an hypothesis that we will be testing. We need to set both the null and the alternate hypothesis.

The null hypothesis
=================

The null hypothesis is the default assumption that states, there is no difference. In this case the null hypothesis wil be
"There is no difference between the Kenyan 10000m women runners with the Ethiopian 10000m women runners ". The null hypothesis 
is usually denoted as h0.

The alternate hypothesis
=================

The alternate hypothesis is what you want to prove, which suggests a difference in the groups being tested. In this case our alternate hypothesis is
"Kenyan 10000m women runners are faster than the Ethiopian 10000m runners"

To calculate carry out a t-test you need to first to

1. Calculate the t-statistic

2. Set the confidence level

3. Critical value

4. Degrees of freedom

Calculating the t-statistic
=================

The formule for calculating the t-statistic is as follows

.. math::
  t = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{\sqrt{\left( \frac{s_1^2 }{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2 }{n_2} \right)}}



Culculating the means
=====================

The formulae for the mean is the summation of all the values divided by the total number of the values. This is expressed mathematically as follows;

.. math::
  \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i

The significance level
======================

The significance level is the measure of the stregth of the evidence that must be in your sample for you to reject the null hypothesis.
The significance level will help you make the conclusion that there is a statistical difference between the two groups.
The significance level indicates the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. For example a significance level
of 0.05 indicates that there is a 5% risk of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. The lower the significance level the stronger 
the evidence required to reject the null hypothesis. Significance levels are set by the researchers prior to testing the hypothesis.

The critical value
====================

The critical value is the threshold that is used to determine whether you will reject or accept the null hypothesis. 
It's the value that defines the boundary between the region where the null hypothesis is likely true and the region 
where it's likely false. 

The critical value is based on the significance level that has been set and the type of test. It is usually culculated using 
a statistical table or a culculator. For a one tailed test, there is usually one critical value and for the two tailed tests, there
are two critical values indicating the two extremes where the null hypothesis is to be rejected. If the t-statistic falls in the 
critical value region, you reject the null hypothesis.
