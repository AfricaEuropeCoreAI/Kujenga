        "\n\n# Final Project\n\n## Your Mission\nYou've learned some powerful mathematical and computational tools. Now it's time to put them to work on something you care about.\n\nYour final project is straightforward: **Pick a real-world question, find data to answer it, and use the techniques you've learned to tell a compelling story.**\n\n.. youtube:: QQ0YYR2BhFk\n    :width: 100% \n    :align: center\n\nIn the video above, we walk through what makes a great final project and show you examples from past students who have successfully applied what they've learned to answer questions they cared about.\n\n## What Makes a Great Project?\nThe best projects have three ingredients:\n1. **A Question You Actually Care About** \n   \n   * \"Are electric vehicles becoming more popular in my country?\"\n   * \"Does coffee consumption correlate with productivity?\"\n   * \"Can I predict which football team will win based on past performance?\"\n   * \"How has air quality changed in major cities over the past decade?\"\n\n2. **Data You Can Get Your Hands On**\n   \n   * More on this below - but don't worry, we'll show you where to look!\n\n3. **At Least One Technique From This Course**\n   \n   * Linear regression (like the happiness-health analysis)\n   * Statistical testing (like the Ethiopian vs Kenyan runners)\n   * Differential equations (like the SIR model)\n   * Network analysis (like PageRank)\n\n## Project Ideas to Get You Started\nNot sure where to begin? Here are some ideas:\n\n**Health & Lifestyle**\n* Does screen time affect sleep quality in students?\n* Is there a relationship between exercise frequency and mental health?\n* Do vaccination rates correlate with disease incidence?\n\n**Economics & Social Issues**\n* How do education levels relate to income in different countries?\n* Is there a gender pay gap in certain industries?\n* Do crime rates correlate with unemployment?\n\n**Environment & Climate**\n* How has temperature changed in your city over the past 50 years?\n*Can you predict flood risk based on rainfall, elevation, and river discharge data? \n* Does air pollution correlate with respiratory diseases?\n* Can you model population growth in your region?\n\n**Sports & Entertainment**\n* What factors predict a team's success in your favorite sport?\n* Do movie budgets correlate with box office success?\n* Can you model the spread of a viral trend on social media?\n*Do NFL kickers make more field goals when the crowd is louder? \n\n**Technology & Innovation**\n* How has internet access grown globally?\n* Is there a relationship between smartphone adoption and economic development?\n* Can you predict tech stock prices using trends?\n\n## Where to Find Data\nThe internet is full of free, accessible datasets! Here are the best places to start:\n\n**General Data Repositories**\n\n* [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) - Thousands of clean, ready-to-use datasets\n* [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/) - Like Google but for data\n* [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) - Beautiful, clean data on global issues\n* [Data.gov](https://data.gov/) - US government open data\n* [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/) - Classic datasets\n\n**Specific Topics**\n\n* **Health**: [WHO Data](https://www.who.int/data), [CDC Data](https://data.cdc.gov/)\n* **Economics**: [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/), [IMF Data](https://www.imf.org/en/Data)\n* **Sports**: [Sports Reference](https://www.sports-reference.com/), [Kaggle Sports](https://www.kaggle.com/search?q=sports+in%3Adatasets)\n* **Climate**: [NASA Climate Data](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/), [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/)\n* **Social Media**: [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/), [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)\n\n**Tip**: Start with Kaggle or Our World in Data - they have clean, well-documented datasets that work well for learning.\n\n## Cleaning Your Data\nReal-world data is messy. Here's how to clean it:\n"

Check out the [Pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) or this [data cleaning tutorial](https://realpython.com/python-data-cleaning-numpy-pandas/).\n\n## Project Requirements\n\nYour final project should include:\n\n1. **A Clear Question** - What are you trying to find out?\n\n2. **Data Description** - Where did you get your data? What does it contain?\n\n3. **Data Cleaning** - Show how you cleaned and prepared your data\n\n4. **Analysis** - Use at least one technique from the course (regression, t-test, modeling, etc.) # type: ignore\n\n5. **Visualization** - Create at least 2 plots that help tell your story\n\n6. **Conclusion** - What did you discover? What are the limitations?\n\n7. **Code** - Submit your Jupyter notebook or Python script\n\n## Submission Format\nDepending on your instructor's requirements, you may submit either a Jupyter notebook or a Python script. However, we highly recommend using a Jupyter notebook for its ability to combine code, visualizations, and narrative in one place.\nSubmit a Jupyter notebook that includes:\n* Markdown cells explaining your thinking\n* Code cells showing your analysis\n* Visualizations\n* A final conclusion section\n\n**File naming**: ``yourname_final_project.ipynb``\n\n\n## Tips for Success\n\n * **Start simple** - Better to do one thing well than many things poorly\n * **Tell a story** - Guide your reader through your thinking\n * **Make it visual** - Good plots make your findings memorable\n * **Be honest** - If your hypothesis was wrong, that's okay! Explain what you learned\n * **Ask for help** - Stuck? Reach out to your instructor or classmates\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\n 1. Pick a question that excites you\n 2. Find a dataset (start with Kaggle or Our World in Data)\n 3. Download the data and start exploring\n 4. Clean it up and apply what you've learned\n 5. Create visualizations that tell your story\n 6. Share your findings\n 7. Celebrate your hard work and new skills!\n\nRemember: The best projects are the ones where you learn something new about a topic you care about.\n\nHave Any Questions? Ask your instructor.\n"
