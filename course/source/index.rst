In Swahili, Kujenga means to build. This course teaches how to use mathematical models to build our 
understanding of the world around us. But it also builds your own skills, by working on real world examples. 
Here you will learn how to establish statistical relationships between health and happiness; understand how to model 
disease outbreaks; test hypotheses about the fastest runners in the world; and even how Google became so rich and powerful

The course takes six weeks to complete, assuming 8-10 hours of work per week, for a student with at 
the end of (or near the end of) an undergraduate degree in a quantitative subject, like 
computer science, physics, mathematics, economics, bioinformatics, engineering, or similar. 

Completing this course means that you are considered 'PhD ready' for the Grace Alele-Williams 
Pan-African Doctoral School in Computational Thinking and AI. This doesn't mean we give you a place 
on the PhD Programme, but it does mean that you have built the skills to apply.

Experience with programming is required, but we have added a section to get you started there too. 
Many of the examples include code in Python. We recommend you either download 
`Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution>`_ and run the code in `Spyder <https://www.spyder-ide.org>`_ (download .py files). 
or upload the Python Notebook (download .ipynb files) `Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com>`_.
